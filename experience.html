    <h3 class="mb-0">VP of Engineering</h3>
    <div class="subheading mb-3">OpenWater</div>
    <p>After joining the two co-founders of what was then known as vOfficeware, we were a typical software
      consulting shop, building custom applications and websites for companies that needed them. We had desired to
      become a product company and after a few years we finally hit on a product that started to gain traction -
      Awards Software, helping organizations manage their entries and judging workflows. We rebranded as OpenWater
      and have grown the company to the size that it is today. I spend less time programming these days, and most
      of my efforts running operations and customer service.</p>
